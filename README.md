**** This and most other of my repos will get their README update in the future on how the algorithm works and how I implemented my solution****

The second project from my CSCI 36300, Software Design, course taken at IUPUI (Fall, 2023). The project is to practice using aggregation, inheritance, and templates to create
a working array, stack, fixed array, and queue that can hold any basic C++ datatype. This project was also used to practice the SOLID principles, as I needed 
to keep my code from having a rotten design. 

This project used MPC to create the needed Makefile to compile and run the code. However, as it currently stands, this project won't be able run due to the professor having the driver file 
that is used to test the code. 

This project has some issues, namely some includes that need to be fixed and some bad practices that need to be removed, which I will remove as I update this repo and finalize this README page.
